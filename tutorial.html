        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>You're a germ! You're hungry, but luckily you've found some bread. You've got competition though, avoid
          the other germs and capture at least 80% of the slice to progress to the next level! You have 2 minutes
          per level, and you start with 5 lives. Good luck!</p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>Use the arrow keys to move, or WASD. You are the red diamond, the germs are the green circles. Don't let 
          them touch you or your path! If you're on mobile, tough luck. This probably isn't the game for 
          you.</p>
